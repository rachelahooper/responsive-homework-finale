        Let's be real, it's a tough time right now. I'm not a therapist or in
        any way a medical professional, just a nerdy person sharing some things
        that are getting me through it all. I do not own the rights to any
        photos or content seen here.

          <h3>About me</h3>
          Hello! My name is Rachel and I'm a nerd who's dealt with depression
          pretty much my whole life. This website is both a final responsive
          project for SheCodes and my attempt to put some therapeutic nerdery &
          mental health resources all in one place.

          <h3>About this website</h3>
          I needed a subject for my final responsive project and, given the
          current state of things, I needed to keep it real. My geeky obsessions
          and also geeking out on how to support my own mental health has kept
          me going through many tough times - now is no exception. I would love
          for this to help others as well. Again, not a mental health
          professional, just someone who's wanting to share what's worked for
          me.
